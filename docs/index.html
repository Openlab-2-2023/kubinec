        Yo, what's up? My name's Miles Morales, and, well, I'm Spider-Man.<br>
        Yeah, I know. You're probably thinking, "Wait, Spider-Man? Isn't that Peter Parker?"<br>
        Well, yeah... but it's complicated. Let me explain<br>
        I grew up in Brooklyn, New York, with my mom, Rio, and my dad, Jefferson.<br>
        My parents raised me to be respectful, smart, and, most importantly, responsible.<br>
        But man, I just wanted to be a normal kid.<br>
        Go to school, hang out with my friends, maybe play some video games. I wasn't looking to be anyone’s hero. <br>
        Then, one day, everything changed.<br>
        This weird spider bit me<br>
        Next thing I know, I’m sticking to walls, disappearing into thin air, and shooting electricity out of my hands. <br>
        But then... Peter Parker died.<br>
        The original Spider-Man. <br>
        I saw him go down, fighting to protect people, doing everything he could to be the hero this city needed<br>
        That’s when I realized: with these powers, I had a responsibility. I couldn’t just stand by.<br>
        I didn’t think I could live up to Peter’s legacy. How could I? He was THE Spider-Man.<br>
        But then, I put on the suit, and it felt... right. <br>
        Like this was what I was meant to do.<br>
        I still make mistakes, I’m still learning, but I fight for the people of New York just like Peter did.   <br>   
        It’s not about fame or glory for me.<br>
        It’s about doing the right thing. <br>
    </p>
